Defaults to ImitateBrowserBehavior\n\t *                    when the DOM is available, null otherwise\n\t * - onError          A function that is used to handle errors\n\t * - onAbort          A function that is used to handle aborted transitions\n\t *\n\t * When rendering in a server-side environment, the location should simply\n\t * be the URL path that was used in the request, including the query string.\n\t */\n\tfunction createRouter(options) {\n\t  options = options || {};\n\t\n\t  if (typeof options === 'function') {\n\t    options = { routes: options }; // Router.create(<Route>)\n\t  } else if (Array.isArray(options)) {\n\t    options = { routes: options }; // Router.create([ <Route>, <Route> ])\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  var routes = [];\n\t  var namedRoutes = {};\n\t  var components = [];\n\t  var location = options.location || DEFAULT_LOCATION;\n\t  var scrollBehavior = options.scrollBehavior || DEFAULT_SCROLL_BEHAVIOR;\n\t  var onError = options.onError || defaultErrorHandler;\n\t  var onAbort = options.onAbort || defaultAbortHandler;\n\t  var state = {};\n\t  var nextState = {};\n\t  var pendingTransition = null;\n\t\n\t  function updateState() {\n\t    state = nextState;\n\t    nextState = {};\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  if (typeof location === 'string') {\n\t    warning(\n\t      !canUseDOM || process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test',\n\t      'You should not use a static location in a DOM environment because ' +\n\t      'the router will not be kept in sync with the current URL'\n\t    );\n\t  } else {\n\t    invariant(\n\t      canUseDOM,\n\t      'You cannot use %s without a DOM',\n\t      location\n\t    );\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  // Automatically fall back to full page refreshes in\n\t  // browsers that don't support the HTML history API.\n\t  if (location === HistoryLocation && !supportsHistory())\n\t    location = RefreshLocation;\n\t\n\t  var router = React.createClass({\n\t\n\t    displayName: 'Router',\n\t\n\t    mixins: [ NavigationContext, StateContext, Scrolling ],\n\t\n\t    statics: {\n\t\n\t      defaultRoute: null,\n\t      notFoundRoute: null,\n\t\n\t      /**\n\t       * Adds routes to this router from the given children object (see ReactChildren).\n\t       */\n\t      addRoutes: function (children) {\n\t        routes.push.apply(routes, createRoutesFromChildren(children, this, namedRoutes));\n\t      },\n\t\n\t      /**\n\t       * Returns an absolute URL path created from the given route\n\t       * name, URL parameters, and query.\n\t       */\n\t      makePath: function (to, params, query) {\n\t        var path;\n\t        if (Path.isAbsolute(to)) {\n\t          path = Path.normalize(to);\n\t        } else {\n\t          var route = namedRoutes[to];\n\t\n\t          invariant(\n\t            route,\n\t            'Unable to find <Route name=\"%s\">',\n\t            to\n\t          );\n\t\n\t          path = route.path;\n\t        }\n\t\n\t        return Path.withQuery(Path.injectParams(path, params), query);\n\t      },\n\t\n\t      /**\n\t       * Returns a string that may safely be used as the href of a link\n\t       * to the route with the given name, URL parameters, and query.\n\t       */\n\t      makeHref: function (to, params, query) {\n\t        var path = this.makePath(to, params, query);\n\t        return (location === HashLocation) ?
